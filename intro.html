Removing Git User Configuration

To remove your Git user configuration, you can follow these steps:

    Remove Global Configuration:
    If you want to remove the user configuration globally (for all repositories on your system), you can run the following commands:

    git config --global --unset user.name
    git config --global --unset user.email

This will remove the user.name and user.email entries from your global Git configuration file, typically located at ~/.gitconfig (on Linux/macOS) or %USERPROFILE%\.gitconfig (on Windows).

Remove Local Configuration:
If you want to remove the user configuration for a specific repository, you can run the following commands within the repository's directory:

git config --local --unset user.name
git config --local --unset user.email

This will remove the user.name and user.email entries from the local Git configuration file, typically located at .git/config within the repository.

Verify the Changes:
After running the above commands, you can verify that the user configuration has been removed by running the git config --list command again. The user.name and user.email entries should no longer be present.
